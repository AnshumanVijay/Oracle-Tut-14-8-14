We need to compile our program before we can run it.

The java compiler translates the source code into byte code for JVM(Java virtual machine) to understand using javac.

Java bytecodes are interpreted and executed by the java interpreter.
Interpreting and running a java program means invoking the JVM byte code interpreter which converts the java byte codes to platform dependent machine codes so our computer can understand and run it.

When we compile a java source file, the compiler creates a file with the .class extension in the same folder as the source file with the same name as that of the file.
---------------------------------------

To run a java program, public class and public static void main should be there.
public static void main(String[] args)-----
public ---So that the member can be accessed outside the class in which it is declared.
static --- allows main() to be called without having to instantiate a particular instance of the class.
void --- main() does not return a value.
main() --- It is the method called when an application begins.
String[] args --- It declares a parameter called args, which is an array of instances of the class String.
